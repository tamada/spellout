C,Carbon   # "Shorter and punchier than ""Charlie""; ends with a clear 'N'."
D,Dagger   # Aggressive 'D' sound that is harder to mistake for 'B' or 'V'.
E,Echo-Six # Reinforced with a numeric suffix to prevent confusion with similar vowels.
F,Factor   # Strong fricative 'F' anchored by a sharp 'T'.
G,Gasket   # "Offers a thicker mid-range frequency than ""Golf,"" cutting through noise."
