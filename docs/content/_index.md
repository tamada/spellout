## :speaking_head: Description

`spellout` is a Rust library and command-line tool for converting text into various phonetic codes, also known as spelling alphabets. It supports a wide range of predefined alphabets like the NATO phonetic alphabet, as well as custom alphabets defined by the user.

## Features

- **Dual Functionality**: Usable as both a command-line tool (`spellout`) and a Rust library.
- **Wide Range of Alphabets**: Comes with many predefined phonetic alphabets, including international and country-specific ones.
- **Customizable**: Create your own phonetic alphabets by providing a base alphabet with substitutions or by loading definitions from a file.
- **Unicode Normalization**: Optional feature to normalize input strings for consistent conversion.
- **Simple & Fast**: Lightweight and designed for quick conversions.
